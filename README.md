# HOW TO make a um program:

    First type:
        use comp40

    Then type:
        umasm stack.ums calc40.ums printd.ums callmain.ums > ourCalc.um        
    
        (Note that it is important that the stack.ums comes 
        first and callmain.ums comes last)

    Then run the program with a working UM (if there is one):
        ./um ourCalc.um


# To see documentation for the assembly:
    Type:
        umasm -grammar
