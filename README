calc40 RPN calc by Ari Brown and Ge Gao

We believe all of the RPN calculator's functionality
has been correctly implemented.

We used the recommended calling convention.

We chose to implement the print module using
a recursive loop, in which we mod by 10 and then divide
by 10, to obtain and then remove each digit from a number.
We do this until the base case of division by 10 being 0.
We also check if the value is greater than 2^31 - 1, to 
determine if a negative sign should be printed, following
the two's compliment representation.

We spent 4 hours analyzing,
We spent 5 hours writing assembly code
We spent 2 hours debugging
